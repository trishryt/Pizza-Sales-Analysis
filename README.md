# 🍕 Pizza Sales Dashboard  
**End-to-End Data Analysis Project using MySQL & Power BI**

## 📌 Project Objective  
Analyze pizza sales data to uncover insights about sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The goal is to build a dynamic and interactive dashboard for business decision-making.

## 🗂️ Dataset  
- Source: [Pizza Sales Dataset – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nextmillionaire/pizza-sales-dataset)

## 🛠 Tools Used  
- **MySQL:** Data cleaning, analysis queries, metrics calculation  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard, DAX for dynamic metrics

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (MySQL)  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Checked and handled null values  
- Standardized inconsistent data entries  
- Calculated key metrics (e.g., total revenue, average order value)

## 🔍 Data Analysis (MySQL)  
Performed data exploration and analysis using SQL queries:
- Sales performance by product name, size, and category
- Sales trend by hour, day, month, and quarter
- Revenue growth per quarter

## 📊 Dashboard (Power BI)  
Created a dynamic dashboard with:
- KPI Cards: Total Revenue, Total Orders, Total Pizza Sold, AOV, Avg Pizza/Order
- Trendline: Monthly & Quarterly Revenue
- Bar Charts: Revenue by Day & Hour
- Pie Charts: Revenue by Pizza Category & Size
- Top 5 and Bottom 5 Pizza Names by Revenue
- Interactive slicers (Filter by Month, Filter by Quarter)
- DAX calculations for all metrics and growth analysis

## 💡 Key Insights  
- $818K total revenue from 21K orders and 50K pizzas sold  
- Peak sales occur on Fridays and during lunch hours (12 PM–1 PM)  
- Supreme pizzas contribute the highest revenue (~26.4%)  
- Large size is the most popular pizza  
- Positive revenue growth in Q2 (+1.47%), but declined in Q3 and Q4
